                            If it was not evident enough, I like numbers. I kid you not, when numbers do their thing right, it feels amazing to me. Which may explain my favourite puzzle games; Sudoku and Minesweeper. Short, simple, number games. I do like other games though, it is not all numbers and puzzles.<br><br>
                            A few of my favourites are The Messenger, Blasphemous, Super Smash Bros, and Dark Souls. Smash Bros is more of a nostalgia pick akin to a black sheep among my favorites. The main features that attract me to the other games are the overall progression seems very thought out and unique, the non-software designs are nearly flawless in my opinion, and adventuring in each game is very cohesive and immersible.

                            <div>I enrolled in Acadia University's Co-Op program in my second year of studies for my Bachelor of Computer Science degree. I have since taken all three of the required Work-terms for a total of a year's experience in computer science related fields.<br><br>
                                During my first Co-Op, I worked with Scotian Gold Cooperative Ltd. as an IT assistant. There, I was a part of a software development/IT team and learned about the process of creating solutions that fix underlying problems rather that small patch fixes, creating reasonable deadlines, giving accurate project completion estimations, and developed a solid understanding of the company's software and hardware paradigms, notably quickly.<br><br>
                                Afterwards, I completed my second and third Co-Ops with a different company; Reach Student Life Management. At Reach, my responsibilities leaned away from IT and software development for coworkers. I was part of an international software development team that delivered a consistently updated online student management tool. Which entailed enforcing and refining the basic principles of what I had learned at Scotian Gold and my software development skills. I was able to familiarize myself with the workplace and software paradigms quickly, fashioned rational solutions for an online product, and had proven to be capable enough to contribute software to a major version change.

                            One of the first projects I undertook, back in late 2019 as soon as I wrote my first python code, was making a Dungeons and Dragons level 1 character randomizer. For those of you who do not know what this entails, to play DnD, you need a character to play as because DnD is a role playing game. To make a character, you typically have to have to pick your race, class, background, starting equipment (weapons, armor, etc.), and spells if applicable, at level 1. You also need to determine your character's statistics or stats for short. A few other things as well, but those are the main points. In short, this project randomizes all possible choices one could make when building a level one character.<br><br>
                            Going back to my enjoyment of numbers, my next personal project I undertook was creating a Sudoku generator. One day after thinking about it a lot, I felt like doing the math out and came up with what I now believe is a version of a backstep algorithm that makes a complete Sudoku solution. Afterwards, I decided to just fully make a random Sudoku puzzle generator. To make the Sudoku puzzle from the solution, I take a bunch of random clues out of the solution, and then see if the puzzle has no more than one unique solution. When I find a configuration of clues that has the one solution, it is then presented to the user for solving.
