                            <!-- work experience -->
                            <div>I enrolled in Acadia University's Co-Op program in my second year of studies for my Bachelor of Computer Science degree. I have since taken all three of the required Work-terms for a total of a year's experience in computer science related fields.<br><br>
                                During my first Co-Op, I worked with Scotian Gold Cooperative Ltd. as an IT assistant. There, I was a part of a software development/IT team and learned about the process of creating solutions that fix underlying problems rather that small patch fixes, creating reasonable deadlines, giving accurate project completion estimations, and developed a solid understanding of the company's software and hardware paradigms, notably quickly.<br><br>
                                Afterwards, I completed my second and third Co-Ops with a different company; Reach Student Life Management. At Reach, my responsibilities leaned away from IT and software development for coworkers. I was part of an international software development team that delivered a consistently updated online student management tool. Which entailed enforcing and refining the basic principles of what I had learned at Scotian Gold and my software development skills. I was able to familiarize myself with the workplace and software paradigms quickly, fashioned rational solutions for an online product, and had proven to be capable enough to contribute software to a major version change.
